# 家庭看板 Home Dashboard

An always-on wall dashboard for a tablet, showing Hong Kong bus ETAs, a shift-roster
calendar with addable events, and weather — all in one glance.

- **Live:** <https://dargon412.github.io/HomeMiniDisplay/>
- **Target device:** Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 (1340 × 800 landscape), Android Chrome/Firefox
- **No backend, no build step, no dependencies.** Plain HTML/CSS/JS served from GitHub Pages.
  The browser calls Hong Kong government open-data APIs directly (KMB/LWB, Citybus, HKO).

## Features

- **Bus arrivals** — next 3 ETAs per stop/route, for KMB/LWB and Citybus.
- **Calendar** — a 4-day roster cycle (早/夜/休) plus events you add by tapping a day.
- **Weather** — current conditions, a 7-day forecast strip, and per-day icons on the calendar.
- **On-screen settings** — edit stops, roster, weather district and refresh interval from the ⚙️
  page (no code editing needed).
- **Backup** — one button exports settings *and* events to a single JSON file; import restores it.
